The owner/chefâ€™s desire was to create a small, low key setting that would allow him to focus on his passion of creating quality food and craft cocktails in a local neighborhood bar setting. The design solution maximized the tight space and focused on warm, raw materials to develop an intimate, warm, and relaxed atmosphere that played off of the industrial history of the urban neighborhood while also providing the feel of a best kept neighborhood secret. Use of custom 2 person booths was critical in meeting the seating count. The booth nestle between a new rhythm of wood planks breaks the length of the space and also integrate with the back bar, windows, and dirk menus. Custom lighting fixtures -- created with a black aluminum pipe shaft - extend down to accentuate seating zones with an inner pop of red.
